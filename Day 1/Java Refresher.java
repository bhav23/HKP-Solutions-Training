What is Java?
  -[Beginner-friendly] Easy to learn and understand
  -[Secure] Designed to be platform-independent and secure, using virtual machine
      -Why is Platform Independence important?
          -Many programming languages needa compiler to reduce code into machine
          language that user device can understand.
          -Problem is many devices have diff machine languages to compile into 
          -Solution is java compilers convert java code to bytecode which is
          interpreted by a Java Virtual Machine [Dalvik VM]. As long as system has
          Dalvik VM, Java code can run.
          
      -Why is Java Secure?
        -Java apps run on virtual and is separate from the actual device
          -Operating system can shut down Android apps if they become exceed 
          certain limits
  -Object oriented programming
